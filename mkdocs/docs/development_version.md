# Development version

Windows nightly builds can be found here: (https://files.poulsander.com/~poul19/public_files/saland/windows_nightly/)

For Linux the easiest option is to compile it from source (https://github.com/sago007/saland).
It goes like this: 
```
git checkout https://github.com/salandgame/saland.git
cd saland
cmake .
make
#./saland # to run
```
